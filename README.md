# CONSOLIDATED ANSWERS FROM PHL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AMID COVID-19

## Responses/Statements consolidated by DOTr-Comms from the DOTr Press Conference Q & A portion today, 14 March 2020

DOTr Usec. Artemio Tuazon

- ‘Yung no standing policy po ay hindi lang po para sa train kundi para rin po sa mga bus. Dahil po ‘yun sa tinatawag nating social distancing. So, for PUBs and for Trains bawal na po yung tayuan. Number of passengers inside to be controlled. Nabanggit po ni DDG Mendoza yung tungkol po sa Clark. That is one option. Now po, the other option for us is Sangley Airport na operational na po. Ang limitation lang po ng Sangley Airport is Turbo prop. So, Turbo prop flights can be operated out of Sangley.

- Enforcement po ng lahat ng protocols na relative po sa COVID-19 po ay ipatutupad po ng PNP. So we are coordinating with them, they will have several teams around Metro Manila to enforce these protocols. Tapos po, dapat po nating tandaan, itong mga bus pong ito ay may prangkisa sa LTFRB. So regulated po sila ng LTFRB. If they do not cooperate, the LTFRB can give sanctions against them.

- Before po itong press con, nagmeeting na po ang ating Road sector, together with the HPG at tsaka ‘yung mga operators po ng mga roads natin to determine kung saan ilalagay itong mga checkpoints na ito, to make sure that there is ample space to accommodate these people, at isa pa po they have made arrangements na ‘yun pong mga city buses, or city public utilities naman will also be meeting them at these points to ferry them inside the NCR.

- ‘Yung P2P buses po natin from the airport papalabas, ito po ‘yung strictest sense of P2P, pagsakay po nila sa NAIA, wala na pong titigilan ito in any point of Manila or NCR. Ang susunod na po na baba nito either Sangley or Clark.

- Kapag nasa loob po ng NCR, tuloy lang po ang transportation natin, subject only to the social distancing protocols. Ang mababago lang po, ang maapektuhan ay yung provincial natin na papasok sa Manila. Hindi po sila papayagan na pumasok sa NCR at the control point. They have to transfer to a city conveyance.

- Sinabi po ni DILG Sec. Año, if you will note po, ang tatao sa mga checkpoints ay ang PNP, sila po ang in-charge sa enforcement. Kapag po may hindi nakipag-cooperate, una pakikiusapan sila. Kapag hindi po talaga sila nagcooperate, aarestuhin po sila, ‘yun po ang sabi ni Sec. Año.

- Kung sa tanong mo kung gaano kami ka-seryoso, sir, seryoso po kami. Hindi po biro itong COVID-19 na ito. Malaking threat po ito sa buhay ng tao. Kaya ‘yung ginawa po naming protocols, talaga pong paninidigan po naming ipatupad po ito sa lahat. Katulad po ng nasabi kanina, katulong po ang PNP sa enforcement, ang presidente po isinama na sa enforcement ang PNP. Bukod po rito, ang DOTr ay may tinatawag na I-ACT, isasama rin po naming sa pag-eenforce.

- For people na magmumula from Montalban Rizal to Laguna: If they can find alternative routes, better. Pero kung wala po silang madaanan, ipapakita nila ang identification nila, either nakatira sila sa kabila, mag-papass through lang sila sa NCR, just as long as controlled ang travel nila sa NCR, they can pass through.

- Hindi po ito normal or regular na panahon sa atin. Malaki po itong pinagdadaanan natin dail sa COVID-19. At dahil malaki po itong pinagdadaanan natin, kailangan po ng sakripisyo ng lahat  para mapanatili ang health at well-being ng lahat ng Senior Citizens ng NCR. Definitely there will be inconvenience, like I said, these are abnormal times. Hindi po ngayon ang konsiderasyon is ‘yung katulad po ng dati, na ang konsiderasyon po ay ang comfort ng commuters. Ngayon po, ang konsiderasyon is ma-prevent yung spread ng virus. Kaya po ang nililimitahan natin dito is ‘yung movement ng tao. Ang cargo tuloy-tuloy lang po. Commerce will continue, it is only the movement of people that we’re trying to control also to control the spread of virus.

- Private vehicles will also have to pass through checkpoints. For them to enter NCR, dapat ma-justify nila kung ano ang dahilan ng pagpasok ng NCR, kung ang dahilan po nila ay ang trabaho nila nasa loob ng NCR, ipapakita lang po nila ang company ID nila, just to prove that they are working sa loob ng NCR, and they will be allowed. Ganoon din paglabas nila.

- Ang hihingin sa checkpoints: Company IDs, kung walang IDs, certification from the employer basta mapakita kung saan sila nagt-trabaho. Basta maipakita na may trabaho sila sa loob ng NCR.

OTS Usec. Raul Del Rosario

- Hindi lang po sa Pilipinas ito. Globally, ganito po ang nae-encounter natin. Nabalitaan natin, nakita natin kung gaano karami ang namamatay, nawawalan ng trabaho, etc. kaya napakahalaga na tulong-tulong po tayo bilang isang pamayanan. Hindi po pwedeng DOTr lang, PNP lang, IATF lang, ang kabilang dito. Napakahalaga po ng partisipasyon ng publiko. Sabi ng apo ng ating kalihin, kailangannating magsakripisyo para sa ikabubuti ng nakararami.

LTO Asec. Edgar Galvante

- Naka-deploy ang ating enforcers, at katulong dito ang PNP na deputized at kung sa pamantayan naman tungkol sa prangkisa, at restriction sa lisensya, sa rehistro, ipatutupad din natin ito. In fact, whether there is quarantine or not. Kaya kung sila ay makiki-pagsapalaran ng ganoon, mawalang-gala na, maaaring they will suffer further inconvenience sa page-enjoy ng pribilehiyo. Halimbawa katulad nitong lumabas na yung listahan na ang dami-dami pala nilang violation at binabalewala nila, in-evaluate ‘yan ng LTO at in fact nagpatupad na ng pag-suspinde ng lisensya. Kung saan kung nakita na mayroon kang 3 o higit pa within the year ng same violation, suspended ng 3 months ang lisensya. Ngayon kung mayroong more than that ang violation, ieevaluate-in pa ito kung ano pa ang maidadagdag. Ngayon, hindi ito dahil gusting magpahirap kundi sinusunod lang natin ang pamantayan ng ating batas para naman magkaroon tayo ng disiplina sa daan.

- Ito ‘yung kautusan dito, una pakiusap na kayo’y sumunod. Pero kung magi-insist sila na ‘di susunod sa pakiusap eh, aarestuhin po sila. Kung ano yung corresponding sanction under the rules and regulations of traffic, ipapataw sa kanila. Pero kunwari may nature of being a criminal violation, then the corresponding case can be filed against them.

- Bakit importante ‘yung ID at address—kasi kung sa hindi naman hinihingi ng pagkakataon, nagkaroon ng contact with somebody contaminated, kailangan ito sa contact tracing kaya importante rin malaman ang address, hindi ito para alamin kung sino mahaharass o mabubully or whatever. But rather, importante kung sakaling ma-identify na nagkaroon ng isang contact, afflicted with the virus, importante na ma-trace para mabigyang lunas  Kaya importante ‘yung ID.

DOTr Asec. Eymard Eje

- Ang guidelines po na aming inilabas ay pinagtugma-tugma at pinagsama-sama po ang mga konsepto galing sa iba’t ibang sektor sa tagubilin po ni Sec. Arthur Tugade at ito po ay pinag-isipang mabuti hindi para magbigay ng inconvenience sa ating commuters kundi para po sa kaligtasa ng lahat, ito po ay para sa ikabubuti ng mas nakararami upang masugpo po natin ang kumakalat na virus. Sana po maintindihan po ng lahat, sa ngalan po ng Department of Transportation, sana po maintindihan ng lahat ng ang ginagawa natin ay para sa mamamayang Pilipino.

CAAP DDG for Operations Capt. Don Mendoza

- The directive is no domestic flights out of Manila. So that is why we are open to the options of Clark. That is why, as I have said, mayroon po tayong P2P buses that will carry passengers out of Manila and will bring you to Clark. So we are also asking airlines if they can launch extra sections, or extra flights out of Clark. Maluwag po ang Clark, napakalapad po. So definitely, makaka-accommodate pa po sila ng mga extra flights.

- We had an informal meeting with some of the airlines. We are opening the option of arranging it by themselves or in coordination with Manila Airport Authority.

- ‘Yung P2P sa airport, pasahero lamang po ito na galling sa eroplano. Wala na pong ibang kasama. Puro pasahero ng eroplano.

MRT-3 Dir. Michael Capati

- We will implement one-meter social distancing sa tren at sa station platform. At ang reduced capacity po ng tren natin ay mare-reduce siya sa 25% yung dating kinakarga natin na 1,000 plus will be reduced to 250-300 passengers maximum a day. Meaning, Malaki po ang inconvenience nito sa mga pasahero kaya ngayon pa lang ay humihingi na kami ng dispensa dahil bukod sa linya kung saan sila pumipila hanggang sa platform ay i-lilimit po namin ang pagpasok kada pasahero at pati po ang pagsakay sa tren.

- Hindi pa po namin nakikitang magkakaroon ng adjustment considering na marami pong workers pa rin ang sasakay between 8:00-10:00 pm. Exempted po kasi ang mga workers natin sa curfew so we are expecting also riders from that. Tama po, irereview natin ‘yan everyday kung kailangan i-subject sa reduction.

- Expected na-po namin sa MRT-3 na talagang bababa ang servisyo in terms of transporting workers so nagaappeal din kami sa private sector if they can adjust, do flexitime, para ‘di na ma-congest during peak hours sa mga tao. We are appealing also sa private not only sa government.

## Viber message from DILG ASec. Jonathan Malaya

"Each LGU will decide on mall closures. They will make their own policy but they agreed in principle kanina sa MMDA.

Please don't worry about the curfew. Since each LGU will pass their own ordinances (Monday earliest) all that we in DILG/PNP can do in the meantime is to discourage people from moving around and to stay home.

The PNP at the checkpoints can't make arrests of people yet so it's just to discourage people from moving which is the purpose of quarantine."

## Message from Chief Presidential Legal Counsel & Presidential Spokesperson Salvador S. Panelo (Sat 14 Mar 2020 1730H)

On the concerns of workers, including those in media

Following the issuance of the Office of the President of the Memorandum which contains the directives and guidelines relative to the community quarantine imposed in the National Capitol Region (NCR), the Palace stresses that non-essential entry into and exit from the said region is restricted and prevented, respectively.

As a result, entry into or exit from the NCR by workers, including legitimate media practitioners, are permitted only if their travel is essential, and not simply for leisure or otherwise, such as that the purpose thereof is to report for work or conduct essential business in the place of their destination. They shall, however, present proof of the legitimacy of their work or business at border checkpoints so our enforcement personnel can validate the necessity of their entry to or exit from the NCR.

Of course, those who will circumvent or violate the imposed community quarantine, such as presenting false company identification cards or fabricated business agenda, shall be dealt with strictly in accordance with law.

The point of the directives issued by the Office of the President is to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, and in the ultimate, totally eliminate the same from our country. Hence, the Palace asks for the honesty and cooperation of our countrymen as it is now the health and safety of our populace which are at stake.

On the role of the spokespersons in communicating measures against COVID-19

For purposes of clarity, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases has agreed that, aside from the President, only the Presidential Spokesperson and the Secretary of Health may announce or discuss the general policies and guidelines pertaining to the issuances and directives of the Philippine Government in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country.

They may authorize their respective staff to relay or disseminate pertinent information for this purpose, on a case to case basis.

With regard to the details for the implementation of issuances and directives on COVID-19 related matters, heads and spokespersons of implementing line departments, agencies or instrumentalities may speak about specific concerns only in connection with their mandate.

For the information, guidance and compliance of our friends in media and of the general public.

## LTFRB issues Official Statement on Sudden Stop of Operations Without Approval

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) informs the operators or franchise holders that an entity given a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) CANNOT announce any sudden stop on operations without the approval of the LTFRB.

This is tantamount to abandonment of route which is a direct violation of their franchises. Any operator or franchise holders who will participate in such unauthorized practice may have their franchise suspended, revoked, or may face appropriate sanctions based on the agency’s policy issuances.

The LTFRB appeals to the operators / franchise holders to comply with the abovementioned directive on the account of a Nationwide Public Health Emergency and to not add unnecessary panic for our most important stakeholders – the riding public.

On the Stringent Social Distancing Measures to Address COVID-19

After a thorough review of the Office of the President of the directives and guidelines crafted by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea, by order of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, issued a Memorandum addressed to heads of departments, agencies, offices and instrumentalities of the government, government-owned or controlled corporations, government financial institutions and state universities and colleges, as well as local government units.

Contained in the Memorandum are emergency but temporary directives and guidelines which are primarily intended to address the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country.

The stringent social distancing measures imposed in the National Capital Region (NCR), effective March 15, 2020 until April 14, 2020, are set forth as follows:

1. Mass gatherings such as movie screenings, concerts, sporting events and other entertainment activities, community assemblies, and non-essential work-related gatherings shall be prohibited. Essential work-related meetings and religious activities may continue so long as strict social distancing, defined as the strict maintenance of a distance of at least one (1) meter radius between and among those attending, is maintained during the entirety of the event.

2. Local Government Units (LGUs) shall abide by the directives of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) in the imposition of general community quarantine in their respective jurisdictions.

For this purpose, general community quarantine is defined as a condition where movement of people shall be limited to accessing basic necessities and work; and uniformed personnel and quarantine officers shall be present at border points.

Thus, subject to qualifications that the IATF may further provide, all areas under general community quarantine shall implement the following:

a. Restrict the non-essential entry of people to the contained area, especially persons who are at high risk of being infected (i.e., 60 years old and above, immunocompromised or with co-morbidities and pregnant women), except (1) health workers, (2) authorized government officials, (3) those travelling for medical or humanitarian reasons, (4) persons transiting to airports for travel abroad, (5) persons providing basic services and public utilities, and (6) essential skeletal workforce; and

b. Prevent the non-essential exit of people out of the contained area, except (1) health workers, (2) authorized government officials, (3) those travelling for medical or humanitarian reasons, and (4) those who were granted entry based on the above-mentioned provisions, provided that all persons leaving the contained community must be checked for signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, respiratory symptoms, diarrhea) at exit checkpoints where (1) appropriate certification will be issued by the competent health authority (DOH or Provincial/City/Municipal Health Officer), (2) health authority endorses exiting person to recipient LGU, (3) exiting persons to undertake 14-day home based quarantine, and (4) LGUs are required to monitor implementation of home-based quarantine.

However, if circumstances so warrant, the DOH and the DILG may direct an LGU to impose enhanced community quarantine, which is defined as a condition where strict home quarantine shall be implemented in all households, transportation shall be suspended, provision for food and essential health services shall be regulated, and the presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures shall be heightened.

3. Alternative working arrangements, including but not limited to, work-from home, compressed work week, staggered working hours, and creation of skeletal workforces, shall be implemented in the Executive Branch. All members of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard, and health and emergency frontline services are directed to continue full operation. The Legislative and Judicial Branches, as well as the independent constitutional bodies are encouraged to adopt the same policy.

4. With respect to the restriction on land, domestic air and domestic sea travel to and from the NCR, all workers, whether employed or self-employed, will be provisionally allowed to travel. For this purpose, proof of employment and/or business must be presented at border checkpoints.

5. All departing passengers shall be allowed transit through the NCR. For this purpose, proof of confirmed international travel itinerary, scheduled within twelve (12) hours from entry, should be presented at checkpoints. However, outbound travel to countries where travel restrictions are in place remains prohibited.

6. The movement of cargoes shall be unhampered, regardless of origin or destination.

7. Suspension of classes and school activities in all levels in the NCR shall remain in force until April 14, 2020.

Aside from the current travel restrictions imposed upon foreign travel to and from China, including its Special Administrative Regions, and portions of South Korea, inbound travelers from Iran and Italy (except Filipino citizens, including their foreign spouse and children, if any, and holders of Permanent Resident Visas or 9(e) Diplomatic Visas issued by the Philippine Government) shall be required to present a medical certificate issued by competent medical authorities within forty-eight (48) hours immediately preceding departure signifying that they have tested negative for COVID-19.

In addition, the DOH is authorized to grant exemptions, based on humanitarian considerations, in favor of outbound travelers who wish to travel to jurisdictions where restrictions are currently in place.

The Palace reiterates that all measures imposed are subject to the regular review by the President and the IATF in order to ensure that the virus would be contained and ultimately eliminated without extremely overwhelming the citizens in going about their daily lives.

A copy of the Memorandum containing the comprehensive list of directives and their corresponding guidelines will be released by the Palace.

As always, the President is hard at work in the service of the Filipino people to preserve the general welfare and protect public health.

## Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles

- IATF will meet everyday to monitor development of COVID-19.

- Pati mga nasa labas ng Metro Manila ay atin ding binabantayan

- PRRD will preside the IATF meetings matapos itaas sa code red sub-level 2

- The transport of goods to Metro Manila from the provinces and vice versa will remain subject to guidelines. This means that residents of NCR should not worry about the supplies of produce, foods and other goods in our markets, groceries and retailers. ‘wag po tayong mag-hoard ng pagkain at mga kagamitan.

- Flights from Metro Manila going to and coming from abroad will be allowed subject to travel restrictions that are currently in place.

- If you are a Filipino citizen and you are coming from abroad you will be allowed to come home subject to strict quarantine guidelines. Foreign nationals who want to fly home from Metro Manila to their respective countries will be allowed to do so. However, very strict and stringent travel restrictions will be imposed upon those traveling from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions.  

- Anyone flying in from abroad via NAIA will remain in Metro Manila until the domestic travel ban is lifted, and again, that begins on March 15, if the ultimate destination is in the provinces, we suggest to fly in via Clark, Cebu and other airports not under quarantine. So you can proceed to your ultimate destination in the provinces.

- The suspension of domestic travel will be reviewed on a daily basis and may be lifted earlier if the situation allows it and may be extended further if the situation requires it.

- Strict quarantine restrictions will be imposed on foreign national coming from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions.

- Aside from the suspension of classes, work in the executive department is likewise suspended during the said period in order to reduce opportunities for exposure to the COVID-19. We hope our counterparts in the legislative and judicial branches of government adopt similar measures.

- Skeletal staffing patterns will be put in place and telecommuting and telework may also be considered in order to ensure that public services continue uninterrupted while these are in place.

- Ang frontline services po ng gobyerno ay tuloy-tuloy pa rin po.

- For the private sector, we urge employers to adopt the flexi work arrangements that were outlined in a labor advisory that was issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.

- The DTI has also recommended that manufacturing, retail and service establishments as well as banks remain open to the public on the condition that they undertake the various conditions advised by the Department of Health.

- Mass transport system like LRT, PNR, MRT will also remain operational with the Department of Transportation tasked to institute measures that will protect the riding public from the COVID-19 virus such as regular disinfection protocols and social distancing measures.

- The government is strictly prohibiting mass gatherings during this period. These include concerts, large seminars, and conventions, sporting events and social gatherings and we will provide more details about this later. Particularly as regards masses and worship services and religious gatherings. Makikipag-ugnayan din sa iba’t ibang religions.

- Local officials may also quarantine respective LGUs within Metro Manila. Mayors set to meet today.

## Department of Education Secretary Leonor Briones

- Mula April 13-17 ang maaring pagpilian ng mga paaralan na araw ng graduation ng kanilang mga mag-aaral

- Ilang paaralan, tuluyan nang kinansela ang graduation ceremony
 
### Through Usec. Alain Pascua:

- Schools originally only have 2 weeks of school left. One measure to be taken will be staggered administering of final exams outside Metro Manila. In Metro manila, DepEd possibly looking at online examinations or averaging class standing.

- Ang mga bata ay magpupunta lamang sa mga paaralan next week para magtake ng exam. Pupunta lang sila sa paaralan kung kalian sila papasok.

- On graduation rites, schedules will be adjusted and Briones has given an order that outside Metro Manila, ceremonies will be held April 13-17.
 
## Department of Agriculture Secretary William Dar

- All the cargos, goods, agricultural will pass without any interference.

- If there will be problem, we will work this out with the police and military

### Through Assistant Secretary Noel Reyes

- Pag-uusapan sa pulong mamaya ang tiyak at sapat na supply ng pagkain o produkto.

- Huwag mag-panic. Mayroon po para sa lahat. Maging mahinahon.

## Metropolitan Manila Development Authority General Manager Jojo Garcia

- Ni-lift na po natin ang number coding para magkaroon po ng mobility ang mga tao para magawa na nila ang mga dapat gawin

- Maari pong magpatawag ng pulong ang DILG kasama ang mga Alkalde ng Metro Manila at MMDA

## Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Dir. Prospero De Vera

- Online modules maaring gamitin ng mga university para sa kanilang mga estudyante

- Ipinauubaya na namin sa mga private university sa labas ng Metro Manila kung magdedeklara ng class suspension.

- Nakikiusap kami sa mga ospital, ‘wag pilitin ang mga medical student interns na. mag-duty sa ospital.  Hindi pa naman sila talaga medical professionals.

## Philippine National Police Major Gen. Benigno Durana

- Sa ngayon, wala kaming data kung ilan ang ilalagay na checkpoint pero maganda kung lahat ng entrance at exits at malalagyan.

- ‘Yung mga taong manggagaling sa labas ng Metro Manila ay sasailalim sa screening

- Maximum tolerance po ang ipatutupad ng PNP.

## Department of Trade and Industry Sec. Ramon Lopez

- Work will continue, as well as, supply of basic necessities.

- Banks, stock market, manufacturing businesses to stay open but employers should ensure strict social distancing measures.

- Ang ine-encourage na lang po would be a flexible work arrangement. Especially sa offices, that doesn’t mean na walang trabaho yung wala sa office. Kasi nga with the technology now, ay maraming nakakatrabaho kahit mula sa bahay. So ayan ang ineencourage because the bottomline is less movement of people. So, hindi na sila lalabas ng bahay, maaring kalahati or 1/3 ay nagro-rotate po, pwedeng by batch ang pagkakaroon ng skeletal force sa opisina. Pwedeng by araw or bawat lingo para ho mabigyan ng pagkakataon ditto sa scheme na ito. Skeletal work force or mayroong work-from-home.

- Inassure po natin ang mga nakatira outside Metro Manila at everyday nagcocommute sila, so magpakita lang po ng ID, mga kumpanya, we would require them to issue IDs to their employees lalo na to those kliving outside Metro Manila. Isa rin pong nakikita naming coping mechanism ditto, I’m sure yung ibang kumpanya would just encourage their people to find a place muna dito sa Metro manila, umupa muna sila para less din talaga ang movement ng tao.

- Let me just reiterate-  Work continues. May trabaho po. Precisely, that is the reason why we have  keep it. Para po na ang trabaho po ang pangkabuhayan ng ating mga kababayan will continue. May continuity po. So, mayroong opisina, restaurants, mga malls, lahat ng mga napupuntahan natin ay bukas po ‘yun. At dahil bukas po ‘yun, definitely, ‘yung mga pag-supply of goods--both food and non-food, cargoes can move in and out of Metro Manila. And the importance of that is to secure the continuity of supply. Importante po na may supply tayo kahit naka-quarantine po ‘yan , there’s food, even mga ibang pangangailangan natin, personal goods, personal care products, etc.

- Basta cargo ang dala ng driver or pahinante, papayagan ‘yan papasok. Pati paglabas, may delivery receipt naman po.

- No business disruption. Supply of goods will be assured. And at the same time, prices will be assured.

- Importante na hindi maapektuhan ang daloy ng suplay ng pagkain at iba’t ibang produkto.

- As you know, nung nagdeclare ng of public health emergency so immediately nagkaroon po tayo 60-day price freeze. Ito po would be for food, yung mga nasa SRP natin, of course medicines, medical devices. So nakaprice freeze po ‘yan for 60 days. Sa DA, may mga covered na agricultural products na kasama ‘yan: rice, corn, Cooking oil,  fresh, dried and other marine products, fresh eggs, fresh pork, beef, poultry meat, sugar, and fresh vegetables. Tuloy-tuloy po ang ating ipinatutupad na price freeze.  DOH naman po, essential drugs at under DOE ‘yun naman pong kanilang LPG at Kerosene.

- Katuwang namin ang DILG, PNP at NBI sa pagsawata sa mga mapagsamantalang negosyante.

- Dalawang bote ng alcohol lamang ang maaring ibenta

- Do not panic buy as this can create artificial shortage. There is enough stock of supplies in retail outlets, supermarkets.

- On weddings scheduled during the lockdown period, if they cancel bookings, they should get refunds as this is considered force majeure. Postpone or lessen guests if possible.

- Customers insisting on buying more than what is allowed: Hindi po limitless ang ‘customer is always right’

- Pinapayuhan naming ang publiko na iwasan ang pagbili ng gamot online.
 
## Through Usec. Ruth Castelo

- Cargoes food and non-food okay to move

- Workers can move in and out

- International travel, okay. Requirements to be stated in the IRR.

- Simula sa Lunes, magkakaroon ng supply sa major retailers sa bansa ng face masks.

## Department of Finance Sec. Sonny Dominguez

- Movement of goods not covered by community quarantine of Metro Manila

- We cannot extend the April 15 deadline. We can allow amendment. Without paying of interest subject
 
## Department of Interior and Local Government Sec. Eduardo Año

- Sa midnight po ng March 15 ipatutupad ang community quarantine sa Metro Manila

- PNP places NCR, Regional Offices 3, 4A, 4B and 5 on full alert status

- Ang strategy ay maglagay ng checkpoints sa boundaries ng Metro Manila and neighbouring provinces.

- Those working inside Metro Manila but residing outside will be allowed to travel in and out of the National Capital Region.

- Sa ngayon ay pinapayagan natin ang pagpasok at paglabas sa Metro Manila. Although ine-encourage natin ang mga pribadong sektor na gumawa ng hakbang para sa kanilang mga empleyado.

- Kailangan ng mga manggagawang papasok sa Metro Manila ng ID kung saan sila nagt-trabaho o Certificate of Employment.

- Para hindi ma-defeat ang purpose ng lockdown, papasok ang DOTr para mag-impose ng measurss na ma-enhance ang ating social distancing, sa loob at bus at public transport, basta may kaukulang space. These people are called the Manila population by the day.

- Buses will continue to be allowed to serve workers from the nearby provicnes who work in Metro Manila

- Buses and private cars will have to go through checkpoints 

- Papayagan ang pagpasok ng mga food at non-food items sa Metro Manila

- Maglalabas tayo ng mga exemptions gaya ng mga sumasailalim sa medical interventions and operations

- Ang community quarantine ay depende po sa sitwasyon. Ang LGU ay may kapangyarihan magdeklara ng local community quarantine sa kanilang nasasakupan.

- Ang virus namamatay ng 14 days up to 24 days. Kapag nag-move ang host magmu-move rin ang virus.

- Kapag buong lungsod ang kailangang i-quarantine, kailangan muna itong i-konsulta sa DOH, DILG at IATF.

- Kung magpapatuloy pa ang virus, maaari tayong magsagawa ng mga additional measures.
