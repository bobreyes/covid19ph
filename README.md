- The transport of goods to Metro Manila from the provinces and vice versa will remain subject to guidelines. This means that residents of NCR should not worry about the supplies of produce, foods and other goods in our markets, groceries and retailers. ‘wag po tayong mag-hoard ng pagkain at mga kagamitan.

- Flights from Metro Manila going to and coming from abroad will be allowed subject to travel restrictions that are currently in place.

- If you are a Filipino citizen and you are coming from abroad you will be allowed to come home subject to strict quarantine guidelines. Foreign nationals who want to fly home from Metro Manila to their respective countries will be allowed to do so. However, very strict and stringent travel restrictions will be imposed upon those traveling from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions.  

- Anyone flying in from abroad via NAIA will remain in Metro Manila until the domestic travel ban is lifted, and again, that begins on March 15, if the ultimate destination is in the provinces, we suggest to fly in via Clark, Cebu and other airports not under quarantine. So you can proceed to your ultimate destination in the provinces.

- The suspension of domestic travel will be reviewed on a daily basis and may be lifted earlier if the situation allows it and may be extended further if the situation requires it.

- Strict quarantine restrictions will be imposed on foreign national coming from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions.

- Aside from the suspension of classes, work in the executive department is likewise suspended during the said period in order to reduce opportunities for exposure to the COVID-19. We hope our counterparts in the legislative and judicial branches of government adopt similar measures.

- Skeletal staffing patterns will be put in place and telecommuting and telework may also be considered in order to ensure that public services continue uninterrupted while these are in place.

- Ang frontline services po ng gobyerno ay tuloy-tuloy pa rin po.

- For the private sector, we urge employers to adopt the flexi work arrangements that were outlined in a labor advisory that was issued by the Department of Labor and Employment.

- Ipinauubaya na namin sa mga private university sa labas ng Metro Manila kung magdedeklara ng class suspension.

- Nakikiusap kami sa mga ospital, ‘wag pilitin ang mga medical student interns na. mag-duty sa ospital.  Hindi pa naman sila talaga medical professionals.

- ‘Yung mga taong manggagaling sa labas ng Metro Manila ay sasailalim sa screening

- Maximum tolerance po ang ipatutupad ng PNP.

## Department of Trade and Industry Sec. Ramon Lopez

- Work will continue, as well as, supply of basic necessities.

- Banks, stock market, manufacturing businesses to stay open but employers should ensure strict social distancing measures.

- Ang ine-encourage na lang po would be a flexible work arrangement. Especially sa offices, that doesn’t mean na walang trabaho yung wala sa office. Kasi nga with the technology now, ay maraming nakakatrabaho kahit mula sa bahay. So ayan ang ineencourage because the bottomline is less movement of people. So, hindi na sila lalabas ng bahay, maaring kalahati or 1/3 ay nagro-rotate po, pwedeng by batch ang pagkakaroon ng skeletal force sa opisina. Pwedeng by araw or bawat lingo para ho mabigyan ng pagkakataon ditto sa scheme na ito. Skeletal work force or mayroong work-from-home.

- Inassure po natin ang mga nakatira outside Metro Manila at everyday nagcocommute sila, so magpakita lang po ng ID, mga kumpanya, we would require them to issue IDs to their employees lalo na to those kliving outside Metro Manila. Isa rin pong nakikita naming coping mechanism ditto, I’m sure yung ibang kumpanya would just encourage their people to find a place muna dito sa Metro manila, umupa muna sila para less din talaga ang movement ng tao.

- Let me just reiterate-  Work continues. May trabaho po. Precisely, that is the reason why we have  keep it. Para po na ang trabaho po ang pangkabuhayan ng ating mga kababayan will continue. May continuity po. So, mayroong opisina, restaurants, mga malls, lahat ng mga napupuntahan natin ay bukas po ‘yun. At dahil bukas po ‘yun, definitely, ‘yung mga pag-supply of goods--both food and non-food, cargoes can move in and out of Metro Manila. And the importance of that is to secure the continuity of supply. Importante po na may supply tayo kahit naka-quarantine po ‘yan , there’s food, even mga ibang pangangailangan natin, personal goods, personal care products, etc.

- Basta cargo ang dala ng driver or pahinante, papayagan ‘yan papasok. Pati paglabas, may delivery receipt naman po.

- No business disruption. Supply of goods will be assured. And at the same time, prices will be assured.

- Importante na hindi maapektuhan ang daloy ng suplay ng pagkain at iba’t ibang produkto.

- As you know, nung nagdeclare ng of public health emergency so immediately nagkaroon po tayo 60-day price freeze. Ito po would be for food, yung mga nasa SRP natin, of course medicines, medical devices. So nakaprice freeze po ‘yan for 60 days. Sa DA, may mga covered na agricultural products na kasama ‘yan: rice, corn, Cooking oil,  fresh, dried and other marine products, fresh eggs, fresh pork, beef, poultry meat, sugar, and fresh vegetables. Tuloy-tuloy po ang ating ipinatutupad na price freeze.  DOH naman po, essential drugs at under DOE ‘yun naman pong kanilang LPG at Kerosene.

- Katuwang namin ang DILG, PNP at NBI sa pagsawata sa mga mapagsamantalang negosyante.

- Dalawang bote ng alcohol lamang ang maaring ibenta

- Do not panic buy as this can create artificial shortage. There is enough stock of supplies in retail outlets, supermarkets.

- On weddings scheduled during the lockdown period, if they cancel bookings, they should get refunds as this is considered force majeure. Postpone or lessen guests if possible.

- Customers insisting on buying more than what is allowed: Hindi po limitless ang ‘customer is always right’

- Pinapayuhan naming ang publiko na iwasan ang pagbili ng gamot online.

- Kailangan ng mga manggagawang papasok sa Metro Manila ng ID kung saan sila nagt-trabaho o Certificate of Employment.

- Kapag buong lungsod ang kailangang i-quarantine, kailangan muna itong i-konsulta sa DOH, DILG at IATF.

- Kung magpapatuloy pa ang virus, maaari tayong magsagawa ng mga additional measures.
